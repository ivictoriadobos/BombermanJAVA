# BombermanJAVA
Bomberman game implemented in Java for a school project

The idea ofâ€‹the game is to destroy as many boxes or walls as possible while running away from the enemy in order to find items that increase speed so that you can move faster. Once you can quickly run away from the enemy (initially your speed is much lower than his, you have no chance to escape his attack), you can devise a strategy to destroy the enemy and, finally, apply it.
