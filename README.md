#Bomberman replica in Java

The hero runs away from the enemy, destroys boxes and walls for bonus items (speed item) to increase his chances to face an attack from the enemy.
The enemy moves in random directions and when he notices a possible element to be destroyed (boxes, destructible walls, hero) he gives him instant fire. The hero has a significantly lower initial speed than the enemy.
